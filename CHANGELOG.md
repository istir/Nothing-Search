## 0.0.2

## 0.0.1

- Basic image support
- Thumbnails

## To be done

- Add a SQLite database to speed up the app
- Always serve thumbnails as jpeg (?)
- Keep some thumbnails cached on the disk, probably the most recent ones. The rest can be just served on the fly. If a 256x256 image weighs under 50KB and the cache limit is 512MB there could be 10k images cached at any given time
- Some sort of pagination
